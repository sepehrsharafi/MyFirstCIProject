MyFirstCIProject
This is my first project exploring Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices.
Project Description
This project serves as a learning ground for understanding and implementing CI/CD workflows. It will start as a simple repository but will gradually incorporate various CI/CD elements as I progress through my learning journey.
Goals
The main goals of this project are:

To understand the basics of setting up a GitHub repository for CI/CD.
To learn about YAML syntax and its role in CI/CD configurations.
To implement and experiment with different CI/CD tools and practices.
To develop a practical understanding of how CI/CD can improve software development workflows.

Through this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience with modern development practices that can enhance code quality, streamline deployments, and improve overall project management.
