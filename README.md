MyFirstCIProject
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my very first project where I'm trying to figure out this whole CI/CD thing.
What's this project about?
Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure yet! ðŸ˜… From what I understand, this project is supposed to help me learn about CI/CD. It sounds complicated!

Here's what I'm hoping to accomplish:

Set up a GitHub repository (I think I've done this part already!)
Learn about something called YAML
Try out some CI/CD tools (no idea what these are yet, but I'll figure it out!)
Understand why people say CI/CD is so great for coding projects

I'm pretty new to all of this, so if you're an expert looking at my project, please be kind! I'm here to learn and improve.
